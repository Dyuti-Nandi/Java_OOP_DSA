# Java Learning Programs

## Description
This repository contains Java programs developed while learning **Data Structures, Algorithms (DSA), and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. It serves as a practice and reference repository for understanding core Java programming principles.

## Topics Covered
- **Java Basics:**
  - Variables, Data Types, Constants
  - Operators 
  - Control Structures 
  - Loops 
  - Functions/Methods 
  - Input/Output 
  - Exception Handling 

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - Classes and Objects
  - Constructors 
  - Inheritance 
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction 
  - Encapsulation 
  - Composition & Aggregation
  - Multithreading & Concurrency

- **Data Structures:**
  - Arrays 
  - Strings and String operations
  - Linked Lists 
  - Stacks & Queues
  - Trees 
  - Hashing 
  - Recursion-based problems

- **Algorithms:**
  - Sorting Algorithms 
  - Searching Algorithms 
  - Recursion problems 
  - Algorithmic problem solving on LeetCode & other platforms

- **Practice Problems:**
  - Pattern printing
  - Mathematical and logical puzzles
  - Competitive programming exercises 

## Learning Outcomes
